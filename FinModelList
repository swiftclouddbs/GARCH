Does Every Investment House Have a "Secret Sauce" GARCH Model?
Absolutely! While the basic GARCH framework is well-known, hedge funds, investment banks, and quantitative funds tweak models to fit their strategies. Some examples of proprietary enhancements include:
•	Custom feature selection: Incorporating macroeconomic indicators, options data, or alternative data sources (e.g., Twitter sentiment).
•	Hybrid models: Combining GARCH with machine learning (LSTMs, reinforcement learning).
•	Risk management tuning: Adjusting parameters dynamically based on market regime changes.
Firms like Citadel, Renaissance Technologies, and Two Sigma likely have proprietary GARCH-like models deeply embedded in their trading algorithms.

Every shop probably has custom models that need to brought out of the closet.
